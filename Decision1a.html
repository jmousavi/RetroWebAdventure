						<h1>The Story</h1>
						<p>
							Oh no! You did not notice the floating asteroids surrounding the
							planet. You try to manouver around them, but you end up getting hit.
							Your emergency lights turn on. Unfortuently you are so far into
							the cluster of asteroids that your only hope of survival is landing
							onto the unknow planet. You try your best to land but your rockets
							are not working, causing you to crash onto the planet, and pass out.

							You wake up alone inside your ship, seeing emergency lights
